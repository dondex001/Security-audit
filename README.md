# Security Audit Project – ToyNest LTD

## 🎯 Objective
This project involved performing a **security audit** on a simulated environment representing **ToyNest LTD**, a mid-sized toy company. The goal was to evaluate the organization's security posture, identify potential vulnerabilities, and recommend improvements to strengthen defenses against cyber threats.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in analyzing risks, applying security frameworks, and documenting findings in a professional audit report.
