## **Risk Assessment**

### **Overview of Risks**

Asset management is currently insufficient, and **ToyNest LTD** lacks several key security controls. The company may not be fully compliant with relevant U.S. and international standards.

### **Control Recommendations**

According to the **Identify** function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the company should allocate resources to catalog and classify all assets. This enables proper risk management and helps determine the consequences of potential asset loss on business continuity.

### **Risk Score**

The overall risk is rated **8 out of 10**, reflecting the absence of several essential controls and limited compliance with security best practices.

### **Additional Observations**

The potential impact of asset loss is considered **moderate**, while regulatory and compliance risks are **high** due to insufficient controls. Key findings include:

* All employees currently have broad access to internal data, including potentially sensitive customer information.  
* Customer credit card data is not encrypted during storage, processing, or transmission.  
* Access control policies like least privilege and segregation of duties are not enforced.  
* Measures are in place to maintain data integrity and availability.  
* A firewall is operational with rule-based traffic filtering.  
* Antivirus solutions are deployed and monitored regularly.  
* No intrusion detection system (IDS) is currently in use.  
* Disaster recovery plans are absent, and critical data lacks proper backups.  
* Procedures exist for notifying EU customers within 72 hours of a data breach. Privacy policies and documentation standards are followed for data handling.  
* Existing password policies are minimal and do not meet modern complexity standards (e.g., minimum 8 characters with letters, numbers, and special symbols).  
* There is no centralized system enforcing password policies, occasionally impacting productivity during reset requests.

* Legacy systems are monitored, but maintenance schedules are irregular and procedures unclear.

* The physical premises, including the main office, retail store, and warehouse, are secured with locks, modern CCTV surveillance, and functional fire detection/prevention systems.
